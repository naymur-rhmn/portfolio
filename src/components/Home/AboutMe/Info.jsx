        I have always been fascinated by technology.This passion for technology
        eventually led me to the world of web development, where I could merge
        creativity with functionality, and build things that could be accessed
        and appreciated by anyone, anywhere.

      <p className=" mb-3 font-normal">
        Embarking on this journey, I committed myself to at least two years of
        intensive learning and practice. I started with the basics of HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript, laying a solid foundation before moving on to more
        complex topics. Learning React was a particularly exciting milestone.
